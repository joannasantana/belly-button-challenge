# Belly Button Challenge

Background:

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


Skills Demonstrated:
- JavaScript programming
    - Using D3 library to read in JSON data from a URL source.
    - Using Plotly to create a bar chart and a bubble chart.
    - Creating JavaScript functions and nested functions.
    - Organization of code so data retrieval is done before the remainder of code runs.
    - Creation and population of a drop-down selection menu.
- HTML
    - Understanding of HTML structure and identification of classes and ids to designate JavaScript workflow and att to HTML code.
